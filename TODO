Future / Ideas / Notes:

* App to take a screenshot and auto-create a new ticket. (Maybe java applet?)
* Office Inventory
* Client Inventory (OpenAudit?)
* Scripts to integrate nagios alerts into tickets
* Pending tickets queue.  (Turn potential tickets into actual tickets, deny others)
  - This could be a mail feed from a client admin box.  Don't want things like Win SBS reports
    turning into tickets, but you want messages from the RAID controller becoming tickets
  * RE or rules for turning pending tickets into tickets
* Track technician time
* Managed Service Agreements/Accounts
* Self-signup / integration with client authentication (so clients can use their existing windows domain username and password)
  - Partially complete with the POP3 SSL Auth Backend
* Project tracking (turn a .project file into tickets/assignments)
* Ordering and Shipping
* Document storage
* Knowledge base
* Outlook calendar integration
  - Or iCal/ICS/WebDAV
* Outlook contact integration
  - Gen vcards?
* Integration with Nagios monitoring
